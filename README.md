# ad-viscousfingering

This module is built as an add-on to [MRST](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/) and provides functionality to simulate immiscible displacement and viscous fingering.

The code presented here is a modification of the [ad-scal](https://github.com/omidreza-amrollahi/ad-scal) module developed previously.

to run the code copy the content of this reposity into MRST modules into a folder named "ad-viscousfingering" and run "./examples/Example_run.m" script.
