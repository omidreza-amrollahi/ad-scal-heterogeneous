function model = Create3DRock(model)
% DESCRIPTION:
% Adds 3D gridding information to the model struct, particularly for
% creating a 3D grid based on the experiment geometry and simulation
% settings. This includes calculating grid cell dimensions and positions
% in the x, y, and z directions, and adjusting for boundary cells if
% specified. It also computes the geometry of the grid, identifies inlet
% and outlet cells, and optionally creates saturation number regions for
% simulation.

% SYNOPSIS:
%   model = Create3DGrid(model)

% PARAMETERS:
%   model - A struct containing the following fields:
%       - experiment: Contains saturation functions and geometry (length and diameter) for modeling.
%       - simulation: Includes time stepping, grid cells information, and optionally boundary cells.

% RETURNS:
%   model - The input struct updated with the following fields:
%       - grid: A struct with detailed information about the created 3D grid, including:
%           - area, dx, dy, dz: Area of grid cells and their dimensions.
%           - x, y, z: Arrays defining the positions of grid nodes.
%           - dxs, dys, dzs: Arrays defining the sizes of grid cells.
%           - G: The generated grid, after computing geometry and removing cells outside the specified domain.
%           - remove_mask: Indicates which cells were removed based on geometry.
%           - Inlet and outlet masks: Logical arrays identifying inlet and outlet cells for boundary conditions.
%           - satNum: (Optional) Array defining saturation number regions for simulation.

% COMMENTS:
% - The function handles both uniform and boundary-adjusted grid creation.
% - It is designed to support simulations with specific geometrical constraints, such as cylindrical domains.
% - The implementation assumes a cylindrical coordinate system with adjustments for numerical errors in identifying boundary cells.
